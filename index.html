            <i>
                I have come to light the lamp of love in your hearts, to see that it shines day by day with added luster. I have not come to speak on behalf of any particular [religion]... I have not come on any mission of publicity for any sect or creed or cause; nor have I come to collect followers for any doctrine. I have no plan to attract disciples or devotees into my fold or any fold. I have come to tell you of this universal unitary faith, this [divine soul] principle, this path of love, this... duty of love, this obligation to love. -- Sathya Sai Baba (Sathya Sai Speaks, vol. 8, no. 22)
